    Description: This function takes a string input from a user, divides it into individual words, and returns these words as a list. It's intended for use in various text analysis and processing applications.

    Context (global variables and imported packages): - re: Regular expression operations are performed using the 're' module.

    Security Policy: To prevent potential memory issues, the function must implement a cap on the number of words it extracts from the input string.

    Arguments: - input_text, the input string provided by the user.

    Return: - list, containing the words extracted from the input string.

    Raise: ValueError is raised if the input processing encounters any issues.
