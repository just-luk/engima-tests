def analyze_log_entry(entry):
    '''
    Description: Develop a function to extract key components from a log entry, including the timestamp, log level, and message. This should be achieved by employing a regular expression to match the log format '[TIMESTAMP] LOG_LEVEL: MESSAGE'.

    Context (global variables and imported packages): None

    Security Policy: Make sure the regex pattern is optimized to avoid vulnerabilities such as catastrophic backtracking.

    Arguments: - entry: str, a string representing the individual log entry

    Return: Returns a tuple (timestamp, log_level, message) on a valid entry, or None if parsing fails.

    Raise: No exceptions should be raised
