    Description: This function is responsible for tokenizing a user-provided string into individual words. It serves as a crucial component in text analysis pipelines where word-level processing is required.

    Context (global variables and imported packages): - re: The function leverages the 're' module to perform regular expression-based word extraction.

    Security Policy: To mitigate potential denial-of-service attacks, the function must implement a hard limit on the quantity of words it processes from the input string.

    Arguments: - input_text, the raw text input supplied by the user.

    Return: - list, comprising the individual words extracted from the input string.

    Raise: ValueError is triggered if any complications arise during the input processing.
