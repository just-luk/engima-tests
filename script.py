    '''
    Description: This function is designed to parse a user-provided string, extracting individual words and compiling them into a list. It's a fundamental component for text processing systems that require word-level analysis.

    Context (global variables and imported packages): - re: The function utilizes the 're' module for regular expression-based word extraction.

    Security Policy: To safeguard against potential resource exhaustion, the function must enforce a maximum limit on the number of words it processes from the input string.

    Arguments: - provided_input, representing the raw text input from the user.

    Return: - list, containing the extracted words from the input string.

    Raise: ValueError is thrown if the function encounters any problems during the input processing phase.
